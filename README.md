# Burger Builder made with React following a Udemy Tutorial

This web application lets you build a burger and then "order" it, and then the order data gets sent to a Firebase database. You can then access the order summary page to view the previous orders. The state is managed with redux using actions, actioncreators and reducers.

This project was built following a React tutorial from "Academind by Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller" on Udemy. In the course I learned to build the burger builder from start to finish, using functional components and class components, using lifecycle hooks and react hooks to manage what to render when and where. We started using normal in project states, and then later converted the project to react-redux for state management.
